  about:
    "Being a qualified .NET and SharePoint consultant since 2010, I have several years of experience in Software Development, with a special focus on collaboration and content management platforms, solution integration, and business intelligence. During this period I have also taken two Microsoft Certifications that ensure the technological accuracy. I'm particularly pleased to work with Microsoft technologies especially ASP.NET and C# and I'm always interested in new programming methods as well and new ways of doing things in a more efficient manner.",
